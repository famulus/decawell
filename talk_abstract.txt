"Amateur Nuclear Fusion"

We are building an open source nuclear fusion reactor. 

This is the story of a remarkable fusion device that got it's start with the inventor of television and his fusion device called the Fusor. The Fusor was forgotten because it would never produce more energy than it used. More recently, Robert Bussard improved upon the Fusor to produce the Bussard Reactor (Trademarked as the Polywell). The Bussard Reactor holds the promise of producing net energy. Both devices implement Inertial Electrostatic Confinement (IEC).

Our quest is to build the world's first superconducting Bussard Reactor. The project is open source. Anyone can participate (provided you understand the risks). For the cash poor / risk averse: there is much to code, calculate, engineer, and organize.

The Fusor has a strong amateur tradition. To date about 25 amateurs have fused the atom. 
The Bussard Reactor is an outgrowth of the Fusor, so building a Fusor is a first step towards building a Bussard Reactor.

We are currently building a Fusor largely from inexpensive parts bought on eBay. We hope to fuse the atom soon. 

This talk will look at some of the real world challenges to building these devices - from sourcing vacuum chambers and high voltage power supplies, to keeping yourself safe in the lab around high voltage and ionizing radiation. We will also explore the various fuel mixes these reactors can burn.

Most importantly, we look at the how this technology can go from an amateur endeavor towards break-even fusion. The most epic hack: the birth of the fusion era. Prototype devices can be built on small budgets. Full scale devices will require multi million dollar budgets.

Make no mistake, working on one of these devices is extremely dangerous! Particularly the voltages ranging from 10kV to 250kV! You must know what you are doing!
