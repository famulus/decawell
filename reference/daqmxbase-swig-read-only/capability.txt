      ./ContReadDigChan-ExtClk
        DAQmx Base Error: <err>Specified property is not supported by the device or is not applicable to the task.
          can't use PFI0 with time? Rising Edge bad?
      ./ContWriteDigPort-ExtClk
          DAQmx Base Error: <err>Specified property is not supported by the device or is not applicable to the task.
      ./readDigMultiplePorts
          DAQmxBase Error -200559: Task cannot contain a channel with the specified channel type, because the task already contains channels with a different channel type.
          Create one task for each channel type.
         works when only one port is defined (and read as uint32).
