<p>I thought this was interesting.<a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1007/05/cnr.05.html" title="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1007/05/cnr.05.html"> Drew Griffin talked to</a> entrepreneur and amateur scientist Mark Suppes who is working on trying to make his open source project on nuclear fusion something that potentially moves our country towards a path of energy independence and off our our dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Anything that doesn't have us occupying countries in the Middle East for oil and having the disasters we're seeing in the Gulf is alright in my book if it can be proven to be safe. This sounds as promising as anything else I've heard of with alternative energy solutions for the United States. Hopefully more will come of it if it proves viable.</p>
<blockquote><p>GRIFFIN: The big I. Just before the break, Carol Costello introduced us to Mark Suppes, an amateur scientist who has put together a nuclear reactor at a warehouse in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>He joins us now live from our studios in New York and you know, Mark, first things first. You design web sites for Gucci?</p>
<p>SUPPES: That's correct.</p>
<p>GRIFFIN: So, you know, where do you cross paths with nuclear fusion? I mean, how did you get into this?</p>
<p>SUPPES: I've been an entrepreneur for almost 10 years now and I've done a lot of web start-ups and a lot of technology, and very comfortable looking at a problem and identifying an opportunity.</p>
<p>GRIFFIN: And so you're sitting around, looking at a problem like how can I put together a nuclear reactor in this warehouse and solve the energy crisis?</p>
<p>SUPPES: I would say it was more like I was between start-ups and I saw this video that Bussard gave and I was so inspired and it looked like such a winning solution to the energy problem, a real way for fusion to work.</p>
<p>GRIFFIN: Who --</p>
<p>SUPPES: And become a real energy solution.</p>
<p>GRIFFIN: You looked at a film of this or a video of this by whom?</p>
<p>SUPPES: Doctor Bussard is the man who invented this technology that I'm trying to build now. And Bussard was a famous physicist, and he worked under a Navy contract for years and years.</p>
<p>GRIFFIN: And so you're kind of picking up on his work, where he left off?</p>
<p>SUPPES: That's exactly right. About a month after he introduced his work to the world, with this video, he passed on. And so somebody has to sort of lead the charge, I feel like.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>GRIFFIN: I know it's not easy, but it seems like it has been somewhat easy for you. You have picked up the material on eBay, you buy the product, I guess, that you need to make this fusion in some New Jersey -- another New Jersey warehouse, right? And then you get this little glow. Now, does that glow mean anything? Are you actually creating energy that you can use at this time?</p>
<p>SUPPES: The device I've built so far is just first step towards a long journey. That device will never produce break-even fusion, and by that I mean producing more energy than it consumes.</p>
<p>But the device that I'm trying to build, and that we're going to build next, the but the reactor holds that promise, if we can build it at the right size, according to his calculations, it should be a break-even reactor. </p>
<p>GRIFFIN: Do you consider yourself just a guy who's doing this as a hobby? I mentioned Thomas Edison. There are other guys that have started out in garages and warehouses, like Boeing, I mean, are you looking towards that type of future for yourself to become an energy giant, pushing us past fossil fuels?</p>
<p>SUPPES: Absolutely. This is not a hobby for me. This is what I want to do with my life. I see working on this at least for the next 10 years.</p>
<p>GRIFFIN: And where are you going to build - first of all, you have to get the money -- a lot of money, right, how much?</p>
<p>SUPPES: That's right, yes. Well, to start with, I don't need that much money. To start with, we could make do with $100,000 to $1 million. But eventually to build the full-size machine, I'm going to need $200 million and then to commercialize it probably another $200 million.</p>
<p>GRIFFIN: How big is the full size machine? Where do you put it and how do you get permitted for all this stuff?</p>
<p>SUPPES: The full-size machine would be about three meters. The core of it would be three meters in diameter and it would be quite large. It would be about the size of a coal-burning power plant. Where you put it, those are questions to be asked a little further down the road, probably somewhere in New Mexico.</p>
<p>GRIFFIN: Yes and now whenever we talk about nuclear energy, there's nuclear waste, there's radioactive material, correct? There's potential dangers involved. Should your neighbors in Brooklyn be worried about what you're doing?</p>
<p>SUPPES: Well, the first thing that needs to be cleared up is the distinction between fission and fusion. When people hear the word nuclear, they usually think of fission, which is what we have today, the current nuclear reactor technology and nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>That's not what I'm doing. I'm doing fusion. Across the board, fusion is much safer. Specifically the project I'm working on is not dangerous at all outside of the laboratory. It is dangerous inside the laboratory. So for myself and the other researchers, we have to be very careful, mostly because of high-voltage electricity.</p>
<p>GRIFFIN: OK, so if this is such a great idea and we already had a Navy scientist working on this, who dropped the ball? Why did it stop and why do you think others aren't pursuing this equally as passionate as you?</p>
<p>SUPPES: Well, the funny thing is that they didn't drop the ball and they haven't stopped. Bussard's original team has been refunded and they are continuing their research in Santa Fe, New Mexico.</p>
<p>The problem is that all of the research is secret and behind closed doors. And so what I'm hoping to do is by doing an open source project, bringing this process of discovery to the public and showing the public what it takes to do original science and to kind of move forward. Very exciting I think to show the process of this.</p>
<p>GRIFFIN: Has the group done any kind of reach out to you? Are they interested in what you're coming up with, the group that's already doing this in New Mexico?</p>
<p>SUPPES: They know about my project. I think to the degree that they can reach out to me, they have. But they have restrictions on what they can say and do.</p>
<p>GRIFFIN: All right, Mark Suppes, from New York. Remember the name folks. He may be the guy that gets us out of these fossil fuels. Thanks, Mark. Appreciate it.</p>
<p>GRIFFIN: I know it's not easy, but it seems like it has been somewhat easy for you. You have picked up the material on eBay, you buy the product, I guess, that you need to make this fusion in some New Jersey -- another New Jersey warehouse, right? And then you get this little glow.

<p>SUPPES: Well, the funny thing is that they didn't drop the ball and they haven't stopped. Bussard's original team has been refunded and they are continuing their research in Santa Fe, New Mexico.</p>
<p>The problem is that all of the research is secret and behind closed doors. And so what I'm hoping to do is by doing an open source project, bringing this process of discovery to the public and showing the public what it takes to do original science and to kind of move forward. Very exciting I think to show the process of this.</p>
<p>GRIFFIN: Has the group done any kind of reach out to you? Are they interested in what you're coming up with, the group that's already doing this in New Mexico?</p>
<p>SUPPES: They know about my project. I think to the degree that they can reach out to me, they have. But they have restrictions on what they can say and do.</p>
<p>GRIFFIN: All right, Mark Suppes, from New York. Remember the name folks. He may be the guy that gets us out of these fossil fuels. Thanks, Mark. Appreciate it.<br />

      <p>Could the editor at least take the time to learn the difference between 'fusion' and 'fission'? They are used interchangeably in this write-up, and they are not the same principles.</p>

<p>SUPPES: Well, the first thing that needs to be cleared up is the distinction between fission and fusion. When people hear the word nuclear, they usually think of fission, which is what we have today, the current nuclear reactor technology and nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>That's not what I'm doing. I'm doing fusion. Across the board, fusion is much safer. Specifically the project I'm working on is not dangerous at all outside of the laboratory. It is dangerous inside the laboratory. So for myself and the other researchers, we have to be very careful, mostly because of high-voltage electricity.</p>

      <p>Heather said "his open source project on nuclear fission" in the first paragraph.  Chasing scientific unicorns in my opinion. </p>
<p>Controlled fusion has been the holy grail of energy sources for 50 years and little progress has been made.  Yes it would be cheap and waste not a problem.  No it hasn't happened with the best minds in the world working on it.  The sun has sufficient gravity to maintain a controlled fusion reaction.  Gives you an idea of the scientific hurdles.  </p>
<p>I'll believe it when I see it.  You really should vet potential scientific breakthroughs with an editor with a science background.</p>

      <p>Indeed. Also, nuclear weapons can exhibit fusion as well as fission.</p>
<p>Producing fusion isn't a problem, it's producing fusion that doesn't go "fizz" and vanish almost immediately, or "KABOOOOOOM" and utterly blow/melt the shit out of everything around it that's the issue.</p>

      <p>1) The last part of the transcript (from "GRIFFIN: I know it's not easy .." to the end) is double posted.</p>
<p>2) Small nuclear fusion reactions are not very difficult to create in a laboratory. But they are tiny and last only a split second. The problem is containing large enough a reaction that its energy can be controlled and used for peaceful purposes. Until someone creates such a working reactor, everything anyone says is just words.</p>

      <p>I stumbled on a completely safe, already built nuclear reactor - the SUN! </p>
<p>When I hear anybody talking about energy all I can think of is the sun. </p>
<p>Solar is the only energy we know. Why not skip all the other processes and collect and store solar energy and quit trying to come up with some way to make a quick buck?</p>

      <p>The notion that this IDIOT knows anything about nuclear fusion is laughable. I can see CNN giving him time because they've long ago devolved into tabloid television. The National Ignition Project at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory only hopes to be able to achieve break even energy this summer after literally decades of work. I can say that I'm building a starship in my back yard but that doesn't make it so. This is a stupid as the idea of cold fusion.</p>

      <p>Exactly David762 - I ran tech support for a 10K user ISP for a number of years back in the Win 3.11 days (there I go dating myself :) )</p>
<p>For the rest of you - If you are using IE8 don't fucking complain if things don't work as they are supposed to - it's not all that standards compliant yet, and wtf are you using IE anyway - piece of crap -always has been. Switch to Opera or FF.</p>
<p><em>[Thank you, tech types, for getting our backs here.  I am NOT a tech, and we have to wait for a problem to be reported many times before we go tugging on the hem of his coat with a problem.

<p><em>This problem was particularly fugitive-and with all the configurations he can make (Windows7 IE8, Vista IE8, XP IE8), he couldn't replicate this in his place until today.

      <p>found what is hopefully a solution and shortened the number of posts on the Front Page to help address it for the ones having problems. Sounded like people getting overloaded between the number of posts, the new sharing features and issues with the ad server. Sad thing is it looks like it's in the new version of IE and not the old one. Gotta' love Microsoft. They come out with something new and it's more messed up than the old version.</p>

      <p>I think it's possible that the underlying problem is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) webpage formatting info loads late in the webpage data stream<br />
which effects<br />
(2) computers with the last generation's level of DRAM and Virtual Memory.</p>
<p>The longer a computer stays on and browsing the internet, the more likely that both Virtual Memory and Physical Memory used as browser cache gets corrupted.  For example, my Mac only has 1 GB of memory, but usually 12 - 16 GB of disk space (VM) free.  I usually operate my browser with Pop-up Windows=OFF, Cookies=OFF, Javascript=OFF, and Plug-ins=OFF, since it tends to load webpages faster (normally).  Fully patched, my OS is the last generation available for this PowerPC-based laptop.  Even in this mode of operation, I have upon occasion experienced the issue others have been complaining about here, and fixed by clearing browser caches and refreshing the website.</p>
<p>I would be willing to bet that you are running 3 - 4 GB of Physical Memory on your computer, along with 100+ GB of Virtual Memory (free disk space).  Those specs can mask an awful lot of memory leaks due to bad html code or badly written commercial software.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>I'm running a Mac with Leopard OS (10.5.8) fully patched, and Safari 5.0.</p>
<p>The only times I have experienced this problem has been after a lot of other browsing (loads of cookies, plus a full &amp; fractured cache).  I've been able to recover by deleting all cookies, flushing the browser cache, and then refreshing the loaded webpage.  The problem goes away immediately.</p>
<p>I believe (SWAG) that there is a problem on this website with badly formed pages using some new (javascript?) code that has memory leaks.  The webpage formatting code is loading late in the data stream, which sometimes drops into a "black hole".  It's too much time and trouble for me to run the webpage load in a "debug mode" for a closer look, nor do I have access to the server side.  I wouldn't be surprised if the web administrator was migrating to HTML 5 (a rapidly moving target) with a lot of fresh new code.  Stuff happens ...</p>
<p>EDIT:  It is also possible that malicious code is being introduced through some of the "linked-in" advertising -- how many here have remarked on some of the Reich-winger ads C&amp;L hosts.</p>
<p>People here experiencing problems like this should consider either restarting their browser, or try another web browser like Safari, FoxFire, or Chrome.</p>

<p>As usual, this is an exciting idea, as fusion is much safer than fission. But also as usual, we have to be wary of people talking out of their hats to gain publicity. Hopefully, it's real.</p>

      <p>I'm not exactly sure fusion can be done on such a small scale as this. Creating a fusion reaction is easy enough, it's containing, controlling, and sustaining it that we haven't been able to do. Oh and bravo CNN on this interview. This reminds me why I don't watch the news anymore. You guys seriously fucking suck.</p>

      <p>There had been steady progress in creating flying devices before Kitty Hawk. Controllable, economical fusion reactions, like a previous poster said, have been the holy grail of energy research for many years. Many billions of dollars have been thrown at solving the problem, and the consensus is that fusion power plants are, at the very best, decades away.</p>

      <p>The Wright's innovation was conceptual. They thought of the aeroplane as something like a bicycle that needed continual adjustment, rather than as something like a balloon that you just steer. Sometimes, the conceptual change can be the big change needed.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Polywell is conceptually somewhat different, using 6 magnetic rings. Furthermore, most of the Polywell research has been done in secret, so the results of the work can't be part of the scientific consensus you speak of.</p>
<p>Clearly, we've dealt with people who turn out to be full of it and are only looking to get on TV. But I'm withholding judgment until we can find out more.</p>

      <p>Magnetic confinement is tokamak.  Bussard's thing uses electrically charged fields.  Sure electricity and magnetism are related, but I believe it's a lot more correct to describe them as electrical rings, not magnetic rings.  </p>
<p>btw: For me, the most persuasive argument that Bussard's ideas are not crazy is that the Navy funded his research for years and years.  They did it a bit quietly, not secretly, so as not to get the researchers doing tokamak work all riled up.  </p>
<p>The idea as I remember it from the 1.5 hour Bussard video on Google-talks was to create electrical fields to attract and accelerate electrically charged ions, (I think) in a containing field.  Then there would inevitably be collisions between the particles, at high velocities, resulting in fusion.  Bussard thought that he could produce fusion using lithium as a desirable fuel, because the products of the fusion reactions would not be radioactive.</p>

      <p>Just because the Navy throws a lot of money your way, it doesn't follow that your idea has any merit. It just means they have too much money to throw at ideas with the potential for military application. Did you notice that Mark Suppes has no understanding of the physics involved?  He watched a video and got excited.  And it was a slow news day at CNN, apparently.  End of story.</p>

<p>Please, oh do please tell us how you know he didn't achieve nuclear fusion, and how you know from this one interview that he doesn;t understand his own work. Maybe you want to enlighten us with your own physics.</p>

      <p>Just because the Navy funds something doesn't mean that it is likely to work.  Just because an internet entrepreneur funds something doesn't mean that it is likely to work, either.  You say he has actually achieved fusion -- and perhaps he has -- but none of his results have been published in the physics literature, so it's really just his (or your) word for it.</p>
<p>The fact remains that the energy he requires to contain his plasma, coupled with the inevitable Bremsstrahlung losses,  exceeds any potential fusion-generated energy.</p>

      <p>He has provably achieved fusion through standard detection of fast-neutrons using a well-understood device known to create fusion.</p>
<p>He's not claiming to have produced net energy, and nowhere claims that he will do so with the fusor he built.  Nobody *can* produce net energy with a fusor, that's not the point.  </p>
<p>Building a polywell device is hard.  Building a fusor is easy.  Both require a lot of the same stuff through, like a working vacuum chamber, gas injection equipment, diagnostic equipment, etc. so why not build the easy thing on the way?</p>
<p>Even his first polywell devices won't possibly make net power, but what they CAN do is validate theoretical results published by Bussard et. all, in an open source format that allows for scrutiny and easy duplication of efforts.</p>

      <p>I'd love to see it work but its a catch-22.  I mean, the accomplishment itself would be monumental and could truly reshape our future.  However, that accomplishment would also be a threat to oil companies profits and we all know what happens at that point.  It would only be a matter of time before enough campaign donations and backroom promises have it declared "a matter of national security" and it vanishes but I digress............</p>

      <p>I've had one miserable week with fighting a bout with poison ivy and saw this and thought it looked interesting and it's something I haven't heard anyone talk about lately. The use of the word fission rather than fusion in the beginning of the post was a tired typo.</p>
<p>I've heard about every form of alternative energy shot down for one reason or the other. Solar, too expensive, unreliable. Wind, unreliable, T&amp;D problems with getting it to the rest of the country. The one person pushing for converting to natural gas is that crook T. Boone Pickins who also wants to promote wind farms as an excuse to steal a bunch of water. Carbon capture for coal, really expensive, takes up a ton of space to add it to existing plants that not everyone has. Algae as a means to clean up coal plant emissions, expensive, unproven, takes up a ton of room again.</p>
<p>Nuclear, what are we going to do with the waste? Very expensive to build new plants.</p>
<p>I would just like to see anything and everything on the table and this guy looking to do an open source project where who knows what ideas might be brought to the table just looked like something at least worthy of some discussion. I didn't mean to get the troops riled up by posting it. I was just hoping for some input on the technology from those that know more about it than I do.</p>

      <p>It is for real, and Mr Suppes is for real. The results are not yet astonishing, but some very bright guy who spent $40,000 of his own cash was able to crate something amazing, contrary to the idiots who have posted otherwise. Reminds me of the AGW deniers who have no clue about the science but know that their aunt Ethel was cold this past winter.</p>

<strong>I thought this was interesting. Drew Griffin talked to entrepreneur and amateur scientist Mark Suppes who is working on trying to make his open source project on nuclear fusion something that potentially moves our country towards a path of energy independence and off our our dependence on fossil fuels.</strong></em></p>
<p>Anything that doesn't have us occupying countries in the Middle East for oil and having the disasters we're seeing in the Gulf is alright in my book if it can be proven to be safe. This sounds as promising as anything else I've heard of with alternative energy solutions for the United States. Hopefully more will come of it if it proves viable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was all I could do to not burst out laughing at your naivete. Then, I realised what YEAR it was, and then I got pissed off. Then I figured:  A TEACHING MOMENT. So listen up, and read this closely. I can back up every single statement with footnotes, but it's late and I haven't got the time. Suffice to say, everything that follows is easy to find out and is as close to actual real facts as I know, and yes, I'm an expert in this, so feel free to quote me.</p>
<p>1. We will get off fossil fuels. That's a guarantee. In the not so terribly distant future (my guess based on the data and assuming consumption continues to grow, sometime around 2020 - 2025) it will take more energy to pull the stuff out of the ground than you get from burning it. This ratio is called Energy Return On Energy Invested, or EROEI for short. Oil's EROEI in 1920 or 1930 was around 100:1 - for every barrel burned, you got 100 in return. Now it is down to about 11:1. I5t's linear, so do the math yourself. At that point, the will leave the oil i nthe ground, because it isn't worth mining as energy. They may continue to mine it so as to use it for materials like plastics, but they will be very expensive plastics...</p>
<p>2. The USA will never stop importing oil. Period. Its own oil production peaked in 1970 (as predicted in the 1950s). It is still one of the largest producers of oil, but it is also one of the largest consumers of oil. Its production curve continues to go down, and will continue to go down, forever. Everything in a technological society is based around oil. Your computer is MADE of oil. Your car is made of and uses oil. FUSION power will NOT fix that. Ever. Wrong kind of energy, and electricity is not a material.</p>
<p>3. The USA is facing a collapse in available oil as other countries peak in production and go into decline. Also, many of them are developing nations and are using more and more of their own oil and natgas for their own needs. As those increase and their production decreases, eventually there is a crossover point, and they stop exporting. This is called the Export Land Model. Examples: Britain, Indonesia. As more of these countries use more of their own production, this will leave importers out in the cold - chief among them? The USA.</p>
<p>4. Fusion is a stupid idea. Why? You don't need fusion. You need electricity. Fusion is a source of heat to boil water to spin turbines to make electricity. There are lots of ways to make electricity and spin turbines. The complexity of fusion is a typical reaction to a shortfall - when threatened, make something more complex to manage the problem. It's what humans do. Unfortunately, it runs up against the law of diminishing returns, and the society has to simplify / collapse. We are o nthe cusp of just such a crisis. Unfortunately, our entire civilisation is sleep walking into this catastrophe. Here's an example: the fusion reactor requires control systems. These are run how? On computers. Computers are made of what? That's right: OIL. Fusion, Fission, Whatever: they all require computers and computers are made of oil, therefore your alternative energy systems are dependent on oil. Merry F'ing Christmas.</p>
<p>Heather: before you post ANYTHING on Energy EVER AGAIN you will read and KNOW the following books, by heart if possible:</p>
<p>1. The Party's Over by Richard Heinberg<br />
2. The Collapse of Complex Societies by Joseph Tainter<br />
3. The End of the World: the Science and Ethics of Human Extinction by John Leslie<br />
4. Collapse by Jared Diamond<br />
5. Overshoot by William Catton<br />
6. A New Green History of the World by Clive Ponting<br />
7. Living Within Limits by Garrett Hardin<br />
8. Endgame Vol 2, RESISTANCE by Derrick Jensen<br />
9. Into The Cool: Energy Flow, Thermodynamics and Life by Eric Schneider and Dorion Sagan<br />
10. GeoDesitinies by Walter Youngquist</p>
<p>Some are easier reads than others. I am confident you can get through them all in 6 months.</p>
<p>Until then, DO NOT post anything on energy issues, because you're clearly completely and utterly clueless on the matter.</p>
<p>By the way - once you read the first five, you will be VERY VERY depressed. Seriously. Don't worry, it will gradually lift after a few months. Then you will realise there is absolutely no hope, and you will panic. Don't worry, that's normal too. </p>
<p>Because then you will learn "hope" is bullcrap. You will learn to make your own hope by doing something positive for you, your family, and your community. Then you will do it again, and again, and get good at it, and you will become more hopeful, because you will have a sense of your own abilities in the face of the the slow motion trainwreck that is the final collapse of technical civilisation.</p>
<p>Read the oildrum.com, get involved with Transition Towns, learn REAL skills, and prepare your children - their world, the world of the die off - is going to be nothing like ours.</p>
<p>You have NO idea what a big fat favour I just did for you.</p>
<p>good luck, you will need it.</p>

      <p>spurring a discussion on alternative energy and whether the man's open source project might bring something to bear we haven't heard about yet. So in your world, as the other commenter noted, we're going to get off of fossil fuels, but we're also never going to stop importing oil. Square those two arguments. And the computers "made of oil" are the reason that technology won't work??? Did I miss something? Give me a f-ing break. Those computers and what they're made of is a much larger problem in all sectors of the economy and a pittance when compared to fuel prices and labor prices when running any type of power generation facility.</p>
<p>Yes, getting us off of petroleum based products and everything from bottled water to what our computers are made of to everything else would go a long way with freeing us from our oil dependence, but that's not what I thought was a topic for discussion here. I was just wondering if the man doing some open source work for other types of generators was viable.</p>
<p>I'm more than happy to hear about whether anyone thinks the man's project will do any good or not. I'm happy to have a discussion about our reliance on oil. I find your remarks extremely insulting and am not going to give up on the idea that some kid thinking out of the box and asking for new ideas might give us some "hope" about getting off of our oil reliance.</p>

      <p>1,. we will get off oil - as i stated above.<br />
2. I'll rephrase for those who can't follow induction:<br />
*As Long As The USA Uses Oil* it WILL import it - unless it can somehow get by on a small fraction of what it uses, which it can't.<br />
3.You wrote:<br />

<p>This is of no consequence. Example: a nuclear power plant. You are not going to go move those rods with a pair of pliers and gardening gloves. They will be computer controlled. They will be machined by devices that are computer controlled. These machines were also designed in computers and made by machines that are also computer controlled. Computers are made of oil. No oil, no machines to make machines, and no machines to control fuel rods, and no control over those fuel rods - therefore: no computers, no nuclear power, especially fusion which requires insane amounts of computation and highspeed reactivity.</p>
<p>You're insulted? I'm WAY more insulted. We (as in progressives) need to be able to tell fact from fiction, up from down, and stupid ideas from smart ideas, and an idea that locks us even more tightly into the complexification process of hyperindustrialism is by definition, a dumb idea, open source or no.</p>

      <p>I don't think Heather is going out and saying something like, "Wow! I'm convinced this will work!" Read the body of what she wrote, and you'll see that she's just being optimistic.</p>
<p>Look, I know a little bit about the topic of fusion. It's interested me since I was a kid. I'm lucky to have an uncle who's a working scientist down at the Oak Ridge labs. Now Uncle Mike doesn't work on the fusion project, at least not directly- he's got a doctorate in Hydro-Thermal Dynamics (steam energy) from Michigan State- but he talks to the guys in the fusion lab a lot. He tells me that we're probably 40-60 years from having the ability to switch our power plants away from carbon fuels (coal, chiefly) completely to fusion. He's always skeptical of claims of people like Mr. Suppes.</p>
<p>But that said, Uncle Mike thinks it's a good thing that people like Mr. Suppes are out there on the airwaves and in the papers making people think about fusion research. Maybe more people will read this story and contact their Congresspersons and get some more funding for legitimate research, ya know?</p>
<p>Please don't be so hard on Heater. She works her ass off on the Video Cafe. Go directly to the VC homepage, and look at how many posts she puts up in a week. And you can bet your ass that if her name's in the byline, she not only wrote the post, but she also captured the vid, watched it to see what she could use, edited it, and dug around for a transcript on-line- and on some occasions, transcribed it by herself. She doesn't deserve to have you or anyone else calling her an attention whore. She deserves your thanks. She's got mine.</p>

<p>· Build a functional vacuum chamber and test setup for future experimentation. *mostly done*</p>
<p>· Create a Farnsworth fusor, and achieve fusion *done*</p>
<p>· Re-create the University of Sydney copper coil polywell experiment. *in progress*  <a href="http://en.wordpress.com/tag/sydney-experiment/" title="http://en.wordpress.com/tag/sydney-experiment/">http://en.wordpress.com/tag/sydney-experiment/</a></p>
<p>· Create the first (known) superconducting magnetic grid polywell device. *in planning* <a href="http://en.wordpress.com/tag/superconducting-magrid/" title="http://en.wordpress.com/tag/superconducting-magrid/">http://en.wordpress.com/tag/superconducting-m...</a></p>
<p>· Scale the superconducting magrid up to commercial scale. *probably still years down the road*</p>

      <p>You sound like you know absolutely nothing about the topic. He has achieved nuclear fusion, which is not too difficult to believe, unless you are gullible to believe that nobody has ever done that. This part is easy to confirm. He is the 38th individual to do so, and I guess since you have not personally read about these others in a peer-reviewd article, you will now tell us how they could not have achieved nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>Note that you are missing the obvious: this is not cold fusion. If you had the time, energy, money, and smarts you could do this too. So could I. But Suppes is the one who did manage to do this and called attention to his methods.</p>
<p>You are only concerned about his 15 minutes of fame. How telling.</p>
<p>No, no, you are correct. He has not achieved nuclear fusion. It's impossible for an individual. It's for the large corporations only. Since the media found out about this and he agreed to his 15 minutes of fame (and hopefully much more), then it is clearly impossible that this story is true. I'm now a firm believer in the Chopvac philosophy -- if you don't proceed by Chopvac's rules (whatever they may be) then any science involved is bunk until proven personally to Chopvac by Chopvac's rules, science be damned.</p>
<p>How telling. Until you read his blog and tell us where he went wrong in his science, you look like a total crank -- or more to the point simply jealous.</p>

      <p>Does he really claim he has done fusion?  Or does he claim that he's done some of the steps toward trying to achieve fusion?</p>
<p>I agree with one of the other people who posted.  This makes progressives look like they're gullible.  I think a healthy skepticism is warranted.  The situation is similar to "cold fusion", which was pretty much debunked.</p>
<p>I would wait on posting items like this until it is proven in the scientific community.  When he's creating electricity, let me know.</p>

      <p>Yes, he has really achieved fusion.  Fast neutron bubble detectors don't lie.  </p>

      <p>Before you show your ignorance read a little bit. If you get stuck go to<br />
<a href="http://www.talk-polywell.org/bb/index.php" title="http://www.talk-polywell.org/bb/index.php">http://www.talk-polywell.org/bb/index.php</a><br />
and ask questions. They are a friendly bunch of geeks who will be glad to answer any questions. </p>
<p>People say we've been down this path before. Not exactly. We spent billions on magnetic confinement. The polywell reactors are much smaller, cheaper, and use inertial electrostatic confinement. And they won't heat water to make steam to make electricity.  The electricity goes straight from the Polywell to the transmission line. </p>
<p>Bussard was one of the people who started the big expensive Fusion projects but soon realized it was a dead end, and thought up the polywell fusion reactor. He would be the first to agree that the original fusion projects are a complete waste of money. </p>
<p>Here the company that is doing the work for the navy.<br />
<a href="http://www.emc2fusion.org/" title="http://www.emc2fusion.org/">http://www.emc2fusion.org/</a> The last few prototypes have definitely reached fusion. They have successfully replicated Bussard's original results and the replication has been double-checked by a peer-review panel. </p>
<p>They are still investigating whether is a practical way of producing electricity. Personally, I'm already convinced It will work and I think we will be driving cars powered by Polywell fusion reactors. They don't have to be huge. Each town can have their own reactor.</p>
